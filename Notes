Product Documentation

Quick Start
In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following steps:

Select or create a Cloud Platform project.

Enable billing for your project.

Enable the Cloud Speech.

Setup Authentication.

Installation
Install this library in a virtual environment using venv. venv is a tool that creates isolated Python environments. These isolated environments can have separate versions of Python packages, which allows you to isolate one project’s dependencies from the dependencies of other projects.

With venv, it’s possible to install this library without needing system install permissions, and without clashing with the installed system dependencies.

Code samples and snippets
Code samples and snippets live in the samples/ folder.

Supported Python Versions
Our client libraries are compatible with all current active and maintenance versions of Python.

Python >= 3.7

Unsupported Python Versions
Python <= 3.6

If you are using an end-of-life version of Python, we recommend that you update as soon as possible to an actively supported version.
